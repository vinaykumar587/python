#We have a number given below. Write a program to check for the divisibility of this number by 3 and 5, and print the result obtained.

a = 12
if a % 3 == 0 and a%5 ==0:
    print("a is divisible by 3 and 5")
elif a % 3 == 0 and a%5 ==0:
    print("a is divisible by 3 or 5")
else:
    print("a is divisible by 3 or 5,but not both")
